# Monthly Land Surface Temperature Heat Map (d3.js) (WiP)

## A Free Code Camp Data Visualisation Project

### Objective:

Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/aNLYPp).

### User Stories:

* I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.
* Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.
* I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.

Work in progress, current snapshot:
